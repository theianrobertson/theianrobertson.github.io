I've been planning out an overnight Bruce Trail hike for quite some time, and had a chance to put my plan into action on a weekend when my son was doing an overnight hike with his Scout troop.  This would be first time I've tried to do a two day overnight trek with a BnB for the night!

## Day 1

On Saturday morning I drove out to park just outside Camp Manitou at the side-of-the-road Bruce Trail parking.  Called an Uber to drive me to Chedoke Park in Hamilton, and I was on my way.  I was worried that I'd not be able to get an Uber out to pick me up, so my backup plan was to just hike southbound from my car to the AirBnB I booked overnight and northbound again the next day.  But luckily the Uber worked out.

The first section was not the most exciting, but after passing the 403 it got much nicer - lots of little up and down, and single track instead of paving.  Lots of cool waterfalls to check out, but I was aiming for about 35 km so I didn't have much time to hang out.

After a bit of a miss nutrition-wise in hiking the Perimeter Trail in Frontenac Provincial Park earlier in the year, I brought more sugary food to make sure I didn't bonk again.  Made myself a couple of jambon-beurre sandwiches for lunch each day.  The French know how to hike!

The last part of the trail before arriving at an AirBnB I booked in Waterdown was past Smokey Hollow Falls.  Lots of people exploring the river below the falls, and a lot of people that were going less distance than me.  Got into my room for the night, showered, went out for ribs and fell asleep before 9:00.

## Day 2

On Sunday I had a time limit for hiking - I needed to get back to my car so that I could go pick up my son from his hike.  So I had another first for me, starting to hike in the dark.  I was out the door by about 6:30 and on the trail with a headlamp on to guide the way.

The trail north had periodic excellent views, especially with the sun coming up.  It was very quiet all day, as there was some clouds and rain blowing in.  

From a nature perspective:
- I saw a few shagbark hickory trees, but didn't find any nuts.  I would guess I was a week or two too late, though also possible that the squirrels had beaten me to them.  
- Lots of snakes around, on both days.  Just little ones though.
- I had a cool up-close experience with a vulture on Mount Nemo, since I was up high and it was hanging out in a tree.

I got very mixed up around
