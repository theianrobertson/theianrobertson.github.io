> Why waste time make many decision when few principle do trick?"

At my day job I need to make decisions all the time, and it's hard to scale decision making. One technique I've had success with when encountering a new decision to be made is to:


1. Step back to align on the principle we want to use when making that type of decision
1. Transparently write down the principle, and share with everyone you made the decision with.  Ideally in a long term place that is easy to find
1. Use that principle next time, and encourage others to do the same

In this way, you can get lots of decisions for the cost of just one decision initially.
